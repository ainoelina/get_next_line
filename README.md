# get_next_line

get_next_line was a project where the goal was to create a function that reads a file and returns a line ending in a newline character. Calling the function again on the fame file, the function reads the next line.
This project deals mostly with handling memory allocation and static variables, and when to free the allocated memory properly to avoid leaks.
